# Cats-Vs-Dogs
Identifying a particular Image is of Dog or Cat with the help of Convolutional Neural Network in python. Building a CNN with the help of Tflearn and Keras. It is an Image classification problem done with the help of CNN. For the Cat image label will be 1 and for the Dog the label is 0. Overall accuracy achieved is 75 percent for the Tflearn model. Models code can be found in Models folder.
